# Cyber Security Writeups
This project contains all my cybersecurity writeups (documentation of my process through hacking challenges.)

## [Ctf](/ctf/)
Ctf's are competitive hacking chalenges, where the players tryes to find a flag (a string ph characters) in a digital system, using different tools and knowledge, depending on the challenge. To win a ctf, you copy and pasted the flag in to a field for submition.

### [PicoCTF](/ctf/PicoCTF)
PicoCTF Is a grate place for practicing your skills in bite sized tasks of different difficulty. 
## [Wargames](/wargames)
Wargames are hacking challengs somewhat similar to CTFs where you have to find an sobit a flag hidden in a digital system, but with no timelimit and often made more for learning, than competing.

### [Hack The Box](/wargames/Hack%20The%20Box)
Hack the Box is one of the most popular and well-known platform for learning hacking and cybersecurity. It's focused on a capture the flag type approach where you're hacking and attacking boxes, popping them, getting privilege escalation, getting root, and moving on. They have different levels of difficulty and there's gamification with the scoreboard.

### [Over The Wire](/wargames/Over%20The%20Wire)
Over the wire is a website with hacking challenges. It has 16 different challenges. Each challenge has a few dozen levels where each level contains the password to procede to the next level. Each level and each challenge is more difficult than the previous. It is therefor great for learning incrementally. 

### [CyberDefenders](/wargames/Cyber%20Defenders)
Cyber Defenders is a cybersecurity learning plattform that focuses on definsive cybersecurity, also called "blue teaming".

## [Incident report](/Incident%20report/)
Incident report challenges simulate a real cyber attack. You are given sufficient information, which you have to analyse to understand the attack. You then write a incindent report containing all relevant information describing the attack.

### [Malware Traffic Analysis](/Incidence%20responce/Malware-Traffic-Analysis/)
Malware Traffic Analysis provide manny incident report challenges with .pcap files describing a cyber attack. Your task is to write a proper incident report of the attack.

## Notes

### Fair play
I want anyone who finds this document to use it to learn. But you wont learn if you are given the answers. So, for all the challenges that you can find permanently on the web and solve yourself, I have not provided the exact answer (The flag), because I don't want to ruin the fun for anyone. The exeption is the timed one-of challenges i have participaded in. There I might add the exact answers.

### Other wirteups
For manny of the cyber security challenges I do, there allready exists other writeups out there. So, do I use them to solve these challenges? Yes, I do. But i try do as little of it as posible.

My goal is to learn cybersecurity, and to become better at it my self. This entire repository is mostly for me to practice how to document my work, since documentation of your work is important in a job, for example as a SOC analyst, or a PEN tester. So i dont care if I cheat because it would de-legitemise my writeups. But I do care if I cheat in a way that makes me learn slower.

So my aproach to solving cybersecurity challenges is:
1. Try my best using all the knowledge i have.
2. Search up information that is related to my curent problem.
3. Use a writeup as help.
4. take notes of what I learned.

At all of the fist 3 steps, if i make progress, I start at number 1 again.
